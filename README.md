# Portfolio: Sports-Company-Data-Analysis

This repository contains SQL scripts developed to analyse a relational dataset for a sports retail company. The dataset includes customer, product, and sales data.

## Project Overview

The scripts demonstrate:

- Data exploration and database familiarisation

- Sales performance metrics and KPIs

## Tech Stack

- SQL (MySQL)

- Tableau (for dashboard development)

- Power BI (planned for further visualisation)
